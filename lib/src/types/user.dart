/// The [DescopeUser] class represents an existing user in Descope.
///
/// After a user is signed in with any authentication method the [DescopeSession] object
/// keeps a [DescopeUser] value in its [DescopeSession.user] property so the user's details are always
/// available.
///
/// In the example below we finalize an OTP authentication for the user by verifying the
/// code. The authentication response has a [DescopeUser] property which can be used
/// directly or later on when it's kept in the [DescopeSession].
///
///     final authResponse = await Descope.otp.verify(method: DeliveryMethod.Email, loginId: 'andy@example.com', code: '123456');
///     print('Finished OTP login for user: ${authResponse.user}');
///
///     Descope.sessionManager.session = DescopeSession(authResponse);
///     print('Created session for user ${descopeSession.user.userId}');
///
/// The details for a signed in user can be updated manually by calling the `auth.me` API with
/// the `refreshJwt` from the active [DescopeSession]. If the operation is successful the call
/// returns a new [DescopeUser] value.
///
///     final session = Descope.sessionManager.session;

///       final descopeUser = await Descope.auth.me(refreshJwt: session.refreshJwt);
///       session.updateUser(descopeUser);
///     }
///
/// In the code above we check that there's an active [DescopeSession] in the shared
/// session manager. If so we ask the Descope server for the latest user details and
/// then update the [DescopeSession] with them.
